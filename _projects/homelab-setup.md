This project documents the homelab I built for practising deployments, virtualization, and network management. I cover Proxmox setup, VM templates, and network segmentation.

Key topics:
- Proxmox installation and configuration
- VM templates and backups
- VLANs and virtual networks

Read on to see config snippets and diagrams.
