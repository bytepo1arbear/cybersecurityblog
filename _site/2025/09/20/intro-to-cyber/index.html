<p>Starting my cybersecurity journey has been both exciting and challenging. After months of research and planning, I’ve finally decided to document my learning process and share it with others who might be on a similar path. This blog will serve as a record of my experiences, challenges, and victories as I navigate the complex world of information security. I hope that by sharing my journey, I can help others avoid some of the mistakes I make along the way.</p>

<h2 id="why-cybersecurity">Why Cybersecurity?</h2>

<p>The decision to pursue cybersecurity came from a combination of factors. First, I’ve always been fascinated by how things work under the hood, especially computer systems and networks. Second, the increasing importance of digital security in our daily lives made me realize this is a field where I can make a real difference. Finally, the constant evolution of threats and defense mechanisms means there’s always something new to learn.</p>

<h2 id="my-learning-path">My Learning Path</h2>

<p>I’ve structured my learning approach around several key areas:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Fundamentals</strong>: Understanding networking, operating systems, and programming</li>
  <li><strong>Security Concepts</strong>: Learning about common vulnerabilities and attack vectors</li>
  <li><strong>Hands-on Practice</strong>: Setting up a home lab and working through CTF challenges</li>
  <li><strong>Certifications</strong>: Planning to pursue CompTIA Security+ and eventually CEH</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="setting-up-my-home-lab">Setting Up My Home Lab</h2>

<p>One of the first things I did was set up a dedicated home lab environment. I’m using VirtualBox to run multiple virtual machines, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kali Linux for penetration testing</li>
  <li>Ubuntu Server for practicing Linux administration</li>
  <li>Windows 10 for understanding Windows security</li>
  <li>Metasploitable 2 as a deliberately vulnerable target</li>
</ul>

<p>This setup allows me to practice various attack and defense techniques in a safe, isolated environment without risking any production systems.</p>

<h2 id="resources-im-using">Resources I’m Using</h2>

<p>Here are some of the resources that have been invaluable so far:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>TryHackMe</strong>: Excellent for beginners with guided learning paths</li>
  <li><strong>HackTheBox</strong>: More challenging but great for practical experience</li>
  <li><strong>OWASP Top 10</strong>: Essential reading for web application security</li>
  <li><strong>YouTube Channels</strong>: NetworkChuck, John Hammond, IppSec</li>
  <li><strong>Books</strong>: “The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook” and “Practical Malware Analysis”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="challenges-so-far">Challenges So Far</h2>

<p>The learning curve has been steep. Some challenges I’ve encountered:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Information Overload</strong>: There’s so much to learn, it’s hard to know where to focus</li>
  <li><strong>Imposter Syndrome</strong>: Feeling like I’ll never know enough</li>
  <li><strong>Time Management</strong>: Balancing learning with other responsibilities</li>
  <li><strong>Technical Hurdles</strong>: Setting up lab environments and troubleshooting issues</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>Over the coming months, I plan to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Complete the TryHackMe Offensive Pentesting path</li>
  <li>Start documenting CTF writeups on this blog</li>
  <li>Build several security-focused projects</li>
  <li>Begin studying for Security+ certification</li>
  <li>Attend local security meetups and conferences</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is just the beginning of what I hope will be a long and rewarding journey in cybersecurity. I’m committed to documenting my progress, sharing what I learn, and hopefully helping others who are starting out. If you’re also beginning your cybersecurity journey, I’d love to hear from you!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more posts where I’ll dive deeper into specific topics, share writeups from CTF challenges, and document my projects.</p>
